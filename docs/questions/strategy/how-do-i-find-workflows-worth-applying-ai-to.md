# How do I find workflows worth applying AI to?

**Short answer:** Run a structured audit of your daily and weekly tasks across three categories — collaborative AI, deterministic workflows, and multi-agent systems — to find where AI can save time, reduce errors, or automate entire processes.

## The Full Answer

Most people adopt AI reactively — they reach for ChatGPT when stuck on an email or ask Claude to summarize a document. That's useful, but it misses the bigger picture. The [Business-First AI Framework](../../business-first-ai-framework/index.md) provides a structured three-phase approach to this question — discover where AI fits, deconstruct those workflows into building blocks, then build.

A proactive, structured audit of your workflows will reveal opportunities you'd never notice in the moment: repetitive tasks that could run on autopilot, decisions that benefit from an AI collaborator, and multi-step processes that could be orchestrated end-to-end.

The key is thinking in three categories. **Collaborative AI** covers tasks where you and AI work together in real time — drafting, brainstorming, reviewing, analyzing. **Deterministic workflows** are repeatable processes with clear inputs and outputs that AI can execute reliably with little supervision — formatting reports, processing forms, generating routine communications. **Multi-agent systems** are complex workflows where multiple AI agents coordinate across steps — research-to-report pipelines, intake-to-triage systems, monitoring-to-response workflows.

To run the audit, use the [Discover AI Workflow Opportunities](../../business-first-ai-framework/discover.md) — a meta prompt that guides an AI through a three-phase process: scanning what it already knows about your work, interviewing you to fill gaps, then producing a categorized report with specific opportunities and actionable first steps.

Once you've identified opportunities, use the [Deconstruct Workflows](../../business-first-ai-framework/deconstruct/index.md) to break individual workflows into AI building blocks and understand exactly where automation fits.

## How to Get Started

1. **Enable memory** in your AI tool of choice (Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini) so the AI can draw on what it already knows about your work
2. **Copy the prompt** from the [Discover AI Workflow Opportunities](../../business-first-ai-framework/discover.md)
3. **Paste it into any conversation** — the AI will scan its context, interview you, and produce a structured report
4. **Pick 1-2 opportunities** to pilot first — don't try to pursue everything at once

!!! tip "Start with Collaborative AI"
    If you're new to AI, start with Collaborative AI opportunities — they're the easiest to try and lowest risk. Move to Deterministic Workflows once you've identified a process you repeat often. Explore Multi-Agent Systems when you have experience with the other two categories.

## Key Takeaways

- Don't wait for problems — proactively audit your workflows to find AI opportunities
- Think in three categories: collaborative AI, deterministic workflows, and multi-agent systems
- Use the [Discover AI Workflow Opportunities](../../business-first-ai-framework/discover.md) meta prompt to run a structured audit
- The richer context your AI has about your work, the better the recommendations
- Start small — pick 1-2 opportunities and pilot them before scaling
