# The Hands-on AI Cookbook

*Curated by [James Gray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesgray/)*

I built this open-source cookbook because I believe AI knowledge should be free and open to everyone. The best gift I can give is helping people accelerate to their full potential — bringing the future forward.

Practical guides, patterns, ready-made tools, and direct answers — everything you need to move from experimenting with AI to getting real results. Browse by platform, look up a topic, or work through a structured course.
