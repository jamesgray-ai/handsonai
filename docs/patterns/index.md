# Patterns

Reusable patterns and best practices for designing and building AI-powered systems.

## Workflow Architecture Patterns

Seven architectural patterns for AI workflows, ranging from simple augmented LLMs to fully autonomous agents. Use these patterns to choose the right level of complexity for your workflow.

## Categories

### Prompting Patterns

Patterns for structuring and optimizing prompts. See the [Prompt Engineering](../agentic-building-blocks/prompts/prompt-engineering/index.md) section for 14 detailed technique guides covering zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and more.

### Agent Patterns

Patterns for building reliable AI agents. See [Agent Capability Patterns](../agentic-building-blocks/agents/capability-patterns/index.md) for seven patterns that make agents effective.

### Integration Patterns

Patterns for robust API integration.

### Error Handling Patterns

Patterns for graceful failure and recovery.

## Adding a Pattern

Patterns use the [topic template](../_templates/topic-template.md). Focus on:

1. **Problem** - When to use this pattern
2. **Solution** - The pattern structure
3. **Example** - Working implementation
4. **Variations** - Common adaptations

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
