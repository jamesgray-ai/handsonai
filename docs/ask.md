# Ask a Question

Can't find what you're looking for? Submit your question and I'll write an answer for the cookbook. Your questions help shape the content — every answer published helps the whole community learn faster.

[Ask your question :material-arrow-right:](https://jamesgray007.notion.site/301edcfdb924805693e7c7ab6aea589b?pvs=105){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" }

## How it works

1. **You ask** — Submit your question using the form above. Include what you've already tried for the best answer.
2. **AI drafts** — A Claude agent researches the topic across the cookbook and the web, then drafts an answer.
3. **James reviews** — Every answer is reviewed, edited, and refined before publishing.
4. **Everyone benefits** — The answer goes live on the cookbook with full AEO schema, so it's findable by both humans and AI.

## Tips for writing a good question

- **Be specific** — "How do I schedule a Claude agent on macOS?" is better than "How do agents work?"
- **Include context** — What platform are you using? What have you tried so far?
- **Pick a topic** — Selecting the right topic helps route your question to the right section of the cookbook.
- **One question at a time** — Focused questions get better, more useful answers.
