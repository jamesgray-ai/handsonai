# Introducing the Changelog and MCP Server

The Hands-on AI Cookbook now has a dedicated **Changelog** and a new **MCP server** — two ways to stay current on what's happening.

<!-- more -->

## Changelog with RSS

Subscribe via [RSS](/feed_rss_created.xml) to get updates in your feed reader, or check the [Changelog](/blog/) anytime. Updates also post to Slack for active cohort members.

This replaces the old "What's New" page with something more intentional — short, curated entries that tell you what changed and why it matters.

## MCP Server

The cookbook now has an [MCP server](/use-the-cookbook/ask/) that lets AI assistants like Claude search and retrieve cookbook content directly. Connect it to Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible client to ask questions and get answers grounded in the cookbook.

For long-form articles and deep dives, head to the [Graymatter newsletter](https://graymatter.jamesgray.ai).
