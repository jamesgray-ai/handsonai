# Identifying and Scaling AI Use Cases

## Why This Matters

This report is the foundation for the cookbook's [six use case primitives](../use-cases/index.md). OpenAI analyzed over 600 enterprise AI deployments and found that nearly all use cases fall into six categories — Content Creation, Research, Coding, Data Analysis, Ideation & Strategy, and Automation. Understanding these primitives helps you classify your own workflows and find the right building blocks faster.

## Key Takeaways

- **Six primitives cover nearly all enterprise AI use cases.** Rather than treating every AI application as unique, the report groups them into six fundamental types of work that apply across departments and industries.
- **Start with repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguity.** The report identifies three areas where AI delivers immediate value: automating tedious work, bridging expertise gaps between teams, and helping employees navigate open-ended challenges.
- **Leadership sets the pace.** Organizations where leadership actively encourages AI adoption see faster results than those relying on bottom-up experimentation alone.
- **Simple use cases beat complex ones for building momentum.** Empowering individual employees to find use cases that work for them is often more effective than launching large, complex AI initiatives.
- **Prioritize by impact and feasibility.** The report provides a framework for gathering use case ideas from across the organization and ranking them by business value, data readiness, and implementation effort.
- **Department workflow mapping accelerates discovery.** Beyond individual use cases, the report recommends mapping entire department workflows to surface systemic AI opportunities.

## How the Cookbook Uses This

The six primitives from this report are the backbone of the cookbook's [Use Cases](../use-cases/index.md) section. Each primitive has its own page with platform-agnostic examples mapped to [Agentic Building Blocks](../agentic-building-blocks/index.md). The report's discovery methodology also influenced the [Discover Workflows](../business-first-ai-framework/discover.md) step of the Business-First AI Framework.
