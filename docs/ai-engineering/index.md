## What AI Engineering Is

AI engineering is the discipline of designing, building, and optimizing systems that use AI models effectively. It goes beyond writing prompts — it's about architecting the entire information environment that shapes how AI behaves.

The [Agentic Building Blocks](../agentic-building-blocks/index.md) describe *what* the components of an AI workflow are. AI engineering describes *how* to work with those components — the practices, techniques, and principles that make the difference between a demo and a production system.

## Practices

| Practice | What It Covers | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **[Context Engineering](context-engineering.md)** | Designing and optimizing the entire context window — system prompts, instructions, tools, memory, and state | Available |
| **Evaluation** | Measuring AI system quality, building test suites, comparing outputs | Coming soon |
| **Observability** | Monitoring AI systems in production — tracing, logging, debugging agent behavior | Coming soon |

## How AI Engineering Relates to Building Blocks

The building blocks are your vocabulary — prompts, context, projects, skills, agents, MCP. AI engineering is the craft of assembling them well.

A useful analogy: the building blocks are like construction materials (wood, steel, glass). AI engineering is architecture and structural engineering — the discipline of designing with those materials so the result actually works.
