## Git Concepts

Understanding these terms helps when working with Claude Code.

### Commit

A **commit** saves a snapshot of your changes with a message describing what you did. Think of it as a save point you can return to.

### Push

**Push** uploads your local commits to GitHub. Until you push, your changes only exist on your computer.

### Pull

**Pull** downloads the latest changes from GitHub to your local copy. Do this before starting work to stay in sync.

### Staging

Before committing, you **stage** files to indicate which changes to include. You can commit some changes while leaving others for later.

## Using Claude Code for Git Operations

Once you have Claude Code installed, you can perform Git operations by asking Claude in natural language:

- "Commit my changes with a descriptive message"
- "Push my commits to GitHub"
- "Pull the latest changes"
- "Show me what files have changed"

Claude Code handles the Git commands for you.

## Troubleshooting

**Can't clone the repository?**
- Verify you have access to the repository
- Check that the URL is correct
- Make sure you're signed into GitHub in your editor

**Authentication issues?**
- Your editor may prompt you to sign into GitHub
- Follow the browser authentication flow when prompted

## Next Steps

- Review the course slide deck for detailed walkthrough with screenshots
- Set up Claude Code CLI to manage Git operations
- Post in Slack if you encounter issues
