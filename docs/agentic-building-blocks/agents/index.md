## Key Concepts

- **Function Calling** - Enabling models to call external functions
- **Tool Use** - Defining and executing tools
- **Agent Loops** - Iterative reasoning and action
- **ReAct Pattern** - Reasoning and acting
- **State Management** - Tracking conversation and tool state
- **Error Handling** - Graceful failure and recovery
