## What Projects Are

**Project workspaces ("Projects")** are professional-grade AI capabilities that scale your expertise and amplify your impact. Instead of starting every conversation from scratch, a project gives the AI persistent memory, specialized knowledge, and standing instructions that shape every interaction.

## Strategic Capabilities

Projects provide three capabilities that turn a generic AI assistant into a purpose-built tool:

### Memory

Build up deep context to guide the AI and improve model performance. Every conversation in a project contributes to a shared history, so the AI learns your preferences, terminology, and working patterns over time.

### Knowledge Base

Embed specialized knowledge, industry insights, and proprietary data that generic LLMs lack. Upload reference documents, style guides, templates, data files, and examples — the AI draws on this knowledge in every conversation without you re-uploading it.

### Custom Instructions

Shape every response an AI gives you inside a workspace. Custom instructions are the difference between a generic assistant and one that knows your role, your standards, and what good output looks like — without you repeating yourself every conversation.

## Platform Options

| Platform | Project Feature | Key Characteristics |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Claude** | Claude Projects | Project knowledge files, custom instructions, conversation history |
| **ChatGPT** | ChatGPT Projects | Project instructions, file uploads, shared conversations |
| **Google Gemini** | Gems | Custom instructions, uploaded context, reusable specialists |
| **Perplexity** | Spaces | Shared research spaces with persistent sources and instructions |
| **M365 Copilot** | Copilot Notebooks | Instructions, Microsoft Graph integration, enterprise knowledge |

## When to Use a Project

**Use a project when:**

- You run the same workflow weekly or more often
- Multiple context files (3+) are needed every time
- The same reference materials are used across conversations
- Conversation memory across sessions would improve quality
- Multiple people need to run the same workflow

**Use a regular conversation when:**

- The task is a one-off or experimental
- Little or no persistent context is needed (0-2 files)
- All context can be provided inline each time

## What Makes a Good Project

The best projects follow one principle: **one workspace, one purpose.**

A "marketing workspace" is too broad. A "blog post review workspace" or "weekly client report workspace" is focused enough to have clear instructions, relevant knowledge, and consistent output quality.

Good projects have:

- **A clear single purpose** — what this workspace does, stated in one sentence
- **Specific custom instructions** — role, task, context, and format guidance (not vague "be helpful" statements)
- **Curated knowledge** — only the reference materials this workflow actually needs
- **Test prompts** — 2-3 prompts you can use to verify the workspace works as intended
