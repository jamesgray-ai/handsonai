# Editing HBR Articles

Edit articles to Harvard Business Review publication standards. Make direct, prescriptive edits.

## Workflow

1. **Read the article** completely before making any edits
2. **Assess against criteria** in [references/editorial-criteria.md](references/editorial-criteria.md)
3. **Make edits** directly to the file, focusing on highest-impact issues first
4. **Provide summary** of changes made and rationale

## Edit Priority Order

Address issues in this order:

1. **Structure**: Does the opening hook? Is the thesis clear by paragraph 3? Do sections flow logically?
2. **Evidence**: Are claims supported with specific data, named companies, and credible sources?
3. **Redundancy**: Cut repeated points, excessive examples (keep 2-3 strong ones), and summary conclusions that rehash the intro
4. **Voice**: Remove hedging, jargon, and promotional language. Strengthen to active voice.
5. **Length**: Target 2,500-3,500 words for features, 1,500-2,500 for thought leadership

## What to Cut

- Throat-clearing openings ("In today's rapidly changing...")
- Redundant examples after a point is proven
- Conclusions that repeat the introduction
- Hedge words ("perhaps," "it seems," "might")
- Business jargon (see editorial-criteria.md for list)

## What to Strengthen

- Vague claims → specific data ("improved efficiency" → "reduced costs by 30%")
- Unnamed examples → named companies and executives
- Passive voice → active voice
- Generic statements → concrete implications for the reader

## Output Format

After editing, provide:

```
