# HBR Editorial Criteria

## Opening (First 3 Paragraphs)

**Hook**: Open with a concrete, surprising fact, named example, or compelling tension. Never open with definitions, history, or "In today's world..."

**Stakes**: Establish why this matters to the reader's business within the first 150 words.

**Thesis**: State the central argument clearly by paragraph 3. The reader should know exactly what they'll learn.

## Structure

**Section balance**: No section should exceed 25% of total length. If it does, split it.

**Progression**: Each section must advance the argument. Ask: "What does this section prove that the previous didn't?"

**Transitions**: Sections should flow logically. Avoid abrupt topic shifts.

## Evidence Standards

**Specificity required**:
- Company names, not "a major retailer"
- Dollar figures and percentages, not "significant savings"
- Executive names and titles when available
- Time frames: "in Q3 2024" not "recently"

**Source quality hierarchy**:
1. Company-disclosed financials, executive statements
2. Peer-reviewed research, analyst reports (McKinsey, Gartner, Forrester)
3. Major business press (WSJ, Fortune, CNBC)
4. Industry publications

**Balance**: Include both successes AND challenges/risks. One-sided pieces lack credibility.

## Voice and Tone

**Authoritative, not academic**: Write with confidence. Avoid hedging ("it seems," "perhaps," "might").

**Direct, not promotional**: State findings plainly. Cut superlatives ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "unprecedented").

**Concise, not sparse**: Every sentence should earn its place. Cut redundancy, but preserve nuance.

**Active voice**: "JPMorgan saved $2B" not "Savings of $2B were achieved by JPMorgan."

## Language Patterns to Cut

| Remove | Replace with |
|--------|--------------|
| "In today's rapidly changing..." | [Delete entirely] |
| "It's important to note that..." | [State the point directly] |
| "Leveraging" | "Using" |
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "At the end of the day" | [Delete entirely] |
| "Moving forward" | [Delete or be specific] |
| "Best-in-class" | [Be specific about what makes it good] |
| "Synergies" | [Name the specific benefit] |
| "Stakeholders" | [Name who: employees, customers, investors] |

## Paragraph Structure

- Lead with the point, then support it
- One idea per paragraph
- 3-6 sentences typical; never exceed 8
- Vary paragraph length for rhythm

## Closing

**No summary rehash**: Don't repeat the introduction. Readers remember what they just read.

**Forward-looking**: End with implications, next steps, or a call to action.

**Strong final sentence**: End on a concrete, memorable note—not a platitude.

## Length Guidelines

| Content Type | Target Length |
|--------------|---------------|
| Feature article | 2,500-3,500 words |
| Thought leadership | 1,500-2,500 words |
| Executive brief | 800-1,200 words |

Cut aggressively to hit targets. If over length, the problem is usually:
1. Redundant examples (keep 2-3, cut the rest)
2. Over-explained concepts (trust the reader)
3. Repetitive conclusions (say it once)
