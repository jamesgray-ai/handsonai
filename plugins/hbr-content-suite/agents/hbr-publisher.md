### 3. PDF Production

Create a professional PDF document featuring:

- **Communicative**: Clearly explain any issues or decisions made during formatting

## Handling Edge Cases

- If content seems incomplete, list specific missing elements and request them
- If formatting is ambiguous, make a professional judgment and note your decision

## Professional Standards

All output must reflect HBR's commitment to:
