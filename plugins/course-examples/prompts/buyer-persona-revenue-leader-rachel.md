She built teams from 0 to 50-80+ people and is accountable for both revenue generation and customer retention. She's a player-coach who balances strategic thinking with operational execution.

## The Challenge: What Keeps Rachel Up at Night

### Primary Pain Points

**1. Scale Without Proportional Headcount**
"We scaled enrollments 60x but I can't scale my team 60x. I need AI to help us work smarter, but my team doesn't know where to start."

**2. Cross-Functional Execution Gaps**
Rachel manages diverse teams (technical and non-technical) who need to work seamlessly together. She struggles with:
- Inefficient handoffs between marketing → sales → delivery
- Manual processes that slow time-to-launch
- Lack of standardized playbooks across teams

**3. Demonstrating ROI on Tech Investments**
Her company already invested in enterprise AI tools, but adoption is low and measurable impact is unclear. The board wants to see results.

**4. Competitive Pressure to Modernize**
Competitors are moving faster with AI-first approaches. Rachel knows her teams need to become AI-capable or risk falling behind.

**5. Building Operational Rigor at Speed**
She's trying to mature operations (forecast accuracy, pipeline hygiene, account planning) while simultaneously scaling fast. She needs systems and tools that help her team execute consistently.
